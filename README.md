# DDCNET_RDC

This system was developed for a work by UFMG - Computer Networks. The goal was to build a link layer emulator for a dummy network called DCCNET. The emulator will handle the encoding, framing, error detection, sequencing and data retransmission in a communication between server and client via socket.
